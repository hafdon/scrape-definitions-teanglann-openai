### **Definition-Specific Instructions**

- **Include Only Core Definitions:**

    - **Noun Definitions (`"noun_definitions"`):**
      - Include definitions under this category if the raw entry indicates a noun.
      - **Do not** include phrases, idioms, example sentences, or redirects.

    - **Verb Definitions (`"verb_definitions"`):**
      - Include definitions under this category **only if** the raw entry has `"v.t."`, `"v.i."`, or both immediately after the word.
      - **"v.t."** stands for "transitive verb."
      - **"v.i."** stands for "intransitive verb."
      - **Do not** include phrases, idioms, example sentences, or redirects.

    - **Adjective Definitions (`"adjective_definitions"`):**
      - Include definitions under this category if the raw entry indicates an adjective.
      - **Do not** include phrases, idioms, example sentences, or redirects.

    - **Other Parts of Speech:**
      - Add additional fields as necessary based on the part of speech indicated in the raw entry.

- **Numbering Definitions:**

  - Numbering should **reset within each part-of-speech category**.
  - Use **Roman numerals (I, II, III, ...)** for each distinct sub-entry within a part of speech.
  - Within each Roman numeral group, list definitions with Arabic numerals `(1)`, `(2)`, etc.
  - **Formatting Definitions:**
    - Within each numbered group, list definitions separated by semicolons.
    - Example:
      ```
      "(I) (1) definition one; (2) definition two. (II) (1) definition three."
      ```
