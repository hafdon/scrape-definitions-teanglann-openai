### Instructions for Simplifying Dictionary Entries: flattening a complex dictionary entry into a JSON object with simplified definitions:

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify the Word**:
   - Extract the main word being defined. In the case of *trácht*, it's the base word.

2. **Categorize by Part of Speech**:
   - Group the definitions by **nouns**, **verbs**, **adjectives**, or any **other parts of speech**.
     - Nouns: Look for entries marked with gender markers like "m." (masculine), or other noun-specific indicators (like genitive singular forms).
     - Verbs: Look for entries involving actions, often accompanied by phrases like "v.t. & i." (transitive and intransitive verbs).
     - Adjectives: Although not in the example, adjectives would describe qualities or states.
     - Other: Anything not falling into these categories can be placed in "other_definitions."

3. **Simplify and Flatten Each Definition**:
   - For each part of speech:
     - **Summarize** the main meaning(s) in a concise way.
     - **Combine** closely related sub-meanings.
     - **Incorporate examples** into parentheses after the definition to show usage, but keep it simple.
     - **Omit complex grammatical details** like genitive forms or case markings unless they are necessary for understanding the meaning.

4. **Structure the Definitions**:
   - Flatten all the noun definitions into a single string for `"noun_definitions"`.
   - Flatten all the verb definitions into a single string for `"verb_definitions"`.
   - Leave `"adjective_definitions"` empty if no adjective definitions exist.
   - Place any remaining parts of speech under `"other_definitions"`.

5. **Format the JSON Object**:
   - Use the following structure:
     ```json
     {
       "word": "<WORD>",
       "noun_definitions": "<NOUN DEFINITIONS HERE>",
       "verb_definitions": "<VERB DEFINITIONS HERE>",
       "adjective_definitions": "<ADJECTIVE DEFINITIONS HERE>",
       "other_definitions": "<DEFINITIONS FOR ANY REMAINING PARTS OF SPEECH HERE>"
     }
     ```
